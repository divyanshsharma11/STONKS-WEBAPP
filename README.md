# Stock Market Webapp
* ***This is a collaborative project created by a team of three***
* ***This is web-app which we have created by using languages like HTML,CSS,FLASK,PYTHON,JAVASCRIPT.***
* ***It basically allows the user to create a watchlist of stocks(chosen by the user).***
* ***It shows real-time price of the added stock and also allows the user to download the data of the stock as an Excel file and also download the graph of the stock too.***
* ***This has a vast scope if we add Machine-learning concept to it.***
* ***Using different machine learning models we can assess the outcome and predict the future price of a particlar stock and can suggest the user whether to buy or sell.***
